# ProductGallery


Build and maintain lists of products that users can purchase. Please create a small native application that has the following features:
A network component that retrieves JSON from this endpoint. The documentation for this endpoint is on this Swagger page.
A screen that shows a list of the retrieved products, their name, and their thumbnails.
A second screen that opens when the user clicks on any of the products on the previous screen. This second screen should show the product details of the product from the first screen.

Although the app should be simple, it should run on a simulator/emulator/physical device. We should be able to build your project on the latest released version of XCode or AndroidStudio. You can reuse patterns that follow industry standards but please do not copy and paste code. We will not be linting your code, but please submit clean, readable code as if you are submitting it to a production project. Finally, your code should be written in such a way that we can scale it and grow it to an enterprise-level production application.
